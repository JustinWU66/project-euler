# Project Euler Solutions

SPOILER ALERT.

This repository contains (probably) all of my solutions to Project Euler problems. I have to admit that for most recent problems I didn't find a one-minute program but most of them run in a reasonable time (under one hour, probably < 10 mins). For just numerical numbers, please take a look at [this repo](https://github.com/luckytoilet/projecteuler-solutions).
